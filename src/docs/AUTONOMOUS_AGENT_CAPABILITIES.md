    id: 'human-review',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      searchResults: z.array(searchResultSchema),
      query: z.string()
    }),
    suspendSchema: z.object({
      searchResults: z.array(searchResultSchema),
      query: z.string(),
      suggestedSelection: z.array(z.number()) // Suggested indices to select
    }),
    resumeSchema: z.object({
      // What the human provides when resuming
      selectedResultIndices: z.array(z.number()),
      additionalInstructions: z.string().optional()
    }),
    execute: async ({ inputData, resumeData, suspend }) => {
      // If this is an initial execution (not resumed)
      if (!resumeData) {
        // Select top 3 results as suggestions
        const suggestedSelection = [0, 1, 2];

        // Suspend workflow and wait for human input
        await suspend({
          searchResults: inputData.searchResults,
          query: inputData.query,
          suggestedSelection
        });

        // Execution pauses here until resumed with human input
        return null;
      }

      // Process resumed data with human selections
      const selectedResults = resumeData.selectedResultIndices.map(
        index => inputData.searchResults[index]
      );

      return {
        selectedResults,

## 8. Integration with Existing Technologies

### 8.1 Mastra vNext Workflow Orchestration

Utilizing Mastra's comprehensive workflow capabilities:
- **Workflow Definition**: Structured TypeScript definitions of process flows using `createWorkflow()` and `createStep()`
- **Step Configuration**: Configuring each workflow step with appropriate parameters and Zod schemas
- **Error Recovery**: Implementing retry logic and fallback mechanisms through conditional branching
- **Event Emission**: Standardized event publication for client updates

#### 8.1.1 Control Flow Patterns

- **Conditional Logic**: Using `.branch()` method with async condition functions to dynamically route workflows based on runtime conditions:
  ```typescript
  .branch([
    [
      async ({ inputData }) => inputData.requiresDeepSearch === true,
      deepSearchStep
    ],
    [
      async ({ inputData }) => inputData.requiresDeepSearch === false,
      standardSearchStep
    ]
  ])
  ```

- **Parallel Execution**: Using `.parallel()` method to run multiple independent steps concurrently for improved performance:
  ```typescript
  searchWorkflow
    .parallel([
      exaSearchStep,
      jinaSearchStep,
      firecrawlSearchStep
    ])
    .then(aggregateResultsStep)
    .commit()
  ```

- **Iterative Processing**: Using `.dountil()` for repeating steps until a condition is met:
  ```typescript
  searchWorkflow
    .dountil(
      // Nested workflow to repeat
      createWorkflow()
        .then(fetchNextPageStep)
        .then(extractContentStep)
        .then(accumulateResultsStep)
        .commit(),
      // Termination condition
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        // Stop when we have enough results or there are no more pages
        return inputData.totalResults >= 10 || !inputData.hasNextPage;
      }
    )
    .then(summarizeResultsStep)
  ```

#### 8.1.2 Workflow Composition

- **Sequential Chaining**: Using `.then()` for step-by-step execution
- **Nested Workflows**: Embedding entire workflows within steps
- **Complex Orchestration**: Combining multiple control flow patterns (conditional, parallel, iterative)
- **Type Safety**: Leveraging Zod schemas throughout for consistent data validation
- **Proper Termination**: Using `.commit()` to finalize workflow definitions

### 8.2 AI SDK and Agent Integration

Leveraging the Vercel AI SDK with Mastra's agent capabilities:
- **Model Selection**: Appropriate LLM choices for each stage of processing using AI SDK model routing
- **Streaming Integration**: Properly connecting LLM outputs to the streaming pipeline
- **Token Management**: Optimizing usage within context limitations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Creating effective prompts for each model and task
- **Agent Registration and Access**: Registering agents with the Mastra instance and accessing them in workflow steps:
  ```typescript
  // Agent registration
  const searchAgent = new Agent({
    name: "searchAgent",
    instructions: "Clear instructions for search capabilities...",
    model: google("gemini-2.5-pro")
  });
  mastra.registerAgent("searchAgent", searchAgent);

  // Agent usage in workflow step
  const enhanceQueryStep = createStep({
    id: 'enhance-query',
    inputSchema: querySchema,
    outputSchema: enhancedQuerySchema,
    execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
      // Get the previously registered agent
      const agent = mastra?.getAgent('searchAgent');

      // Stream the response
      const response = await agent.stream([
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: `Enhance this search query to improve results: ${inputData.query}`
        }
      ]);

      // Process and return the response
      return { enhancedQuery: response.text };
    }
  });
  ```

### 8.3 Tool Integration and Interoperability

Seamlessly integrating tools with agents and workflows:
- **Tool as Step Pattern**: Converting tools into workflow steps using `createStep()`
- **Mixed Step Types**: Combining different types of steps (tools, agents) in a unified workflow
- **Tool Definition and Registration**: Creating tools with clearly defined input/output schemas
- **Tool Usage Example**:
  ```typescript
  // Define a search tool
  const exaSearchTool = {
    id: 'exa-search',
    description: 'Search the web for information',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      query: z.string(),
      numResults: z.number().optional().default(5)
    }),
    outputSchema: z.object({
      results: z.array(
        z.object({
          title: z.string(),
          url: z.string().url(),
          snippet: z.string()
        })
      )
    }),
    execute: async ({ input }) => {
      const results = await exaClient.search(input.query, { numResults: input.numResults });
      return {
        results: results.map(r => ({
          title: r.title,
          url: r.url,
          snippet: r.snippet
        }))
      };
    }
  };

  // Convert tool to step
  const exaSearchStep = createStep(exaSearchTool);

  // Use in workflow
  searchWorkflow
    .then(enhanceQueryStep)
    .then(exaSearchStep)
    .then(processResultsStep);
  ```

### 8.4 Scrapybara/E2B Integration

Combining web extraction with secure processing:
- **Coordinated Extraction**: Using Scrapybara for targeted content gathering
- **Secure Processing**: Leveraging E2B for safe execution of processing logic
- **Content Transformation**: Converting web content to structured knowledge
- **Memory Integration**: Storing and retrieving processed information
- **Integration Pattern**:
  ```typescript
  // Define Scrapybara tool as step
  const scrapybaraStep = createStep({
    id: 'scrapybara-extract',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      url: z.string().url(),
      selectors: z.array(z.string()).optional()
    }),
    outputSchema: z.object({
      content: z.string(),
      metadata: z.record(z.string(), z.any()).optional()
    }),
    execute: async ({ input }) => {
      // Initialize Scrapybara client
      const client = new ScrabybaraClient(process.env.SCRAPYBARA_API_KEY);

      // Execute browser automation
      const result = await client.act({
        instructions: `Visit ${input.url} and extract the main content.`,
        model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
      });

      return {
        content: result.content,
        metadata: result.metadata
      };
    }
  });
  ```

## 10. Implementation Strategy with Existing Stack

### 10.1 AI SDK-Mastra Integration

The foundation of our autonomous agent implementation relies on the powerful Mastra-AI SDK integration:

```typescript
// Core AI SDK-Mastra integration pattern
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { google } from "@ai-sdk/google";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

// Agent configuration with AI SDK model routing
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "QSearch",
  instructions: "Comprehensive instructions for enhanced search capabilities...",
  model: google("gemini-2.5-pro"), // Using AI SDK for model routing
});

// API route integration
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("qSearchAgent");
  const stream = await myAgent.stream(messages);

  // Return the stream response for real-time updates
  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

This integration allows us to leverage AI SDK's model routing (providing a unified interface for Gemini, Claude, etc.), structured output capabilities, and advanced tool calling - all while benefiting from Mastra's agent orchestration, memory management, and workflow capabilities.

### 10.2 Event-Driven Architecture

Our existing event streaming system provides the foundation for real-time updates and agent transparency:

```typescript
// Create a data stream for merging agent outputs with custom events
import { createDataStream } from "ai";

const stream = createDataStream({
  async execute(dataStream) {
    // Custom progress updates
    dataStream.writeData({ value: 'Search initiated' });
    dataStream.writeMessageAnnotation({ type: 'status', value: 'processing' });

    // Mastra agent stream
    const agentStream = await qSearchAgent.stream('What is the latest research on quantum computing?');

    // Merge agent stream with our custom data stream
    agentStream.mergeIntoDataStream(dataStream);
  }
});
```

By combining our TransformStream implementation with AI SDK's data streaming capabilities and Mastra's event system, we can provide rich, real-time feedback throughout the agent's execution cycle.

### 10.3 Reference Implementation Resources

Our codebase already includes reference implementations that can be adapted:

1. **Full Agent Implementation**: The `/ReferencesManus/full-deploy/` directory contains complete implementations of workflow-based agents with tool integration, memory management, and runtime infrastructure.

2. **OpenManus Component Structure**: The `/ReferencesManus/OpenManus-main copy/` provides a robust pattern for agent loop architecture, planning, and tool calling.

3. **Suna Browser Integration**: The `/ReferencesManus/suna-main 2/` implementation demonstrates effective browser tool integration with the agent architecture.

4. **HyperAgent Patterns**: The `/ReferencesManus/HyperAgent-ReadME.md` contains advanced patterns for autonomous execution capabilities.

These reference implementations can be combined with our existing mastra vNext implementation to create a comprehensive autonomous agent.
