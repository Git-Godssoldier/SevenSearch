# Recursive Improvement System for Mastra vNext

This document describes the recursive improvement system implemented for Mastra vNext workflows. The system uses E2B secure runtime to test, analyze, and improve vNext components automatically.

## Overview

The recursive improvement system is a feedback-based mechanism that enhances workflow reliability and performance through iterative refinement. It runs tests in an isolated E2B environment, analyzes the results, identifies potential issues, and suggests code improvements.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **E2B Test Runner**: A secure sandboxed JavaScript execution environment
2. **Event Stream Tests**: Tests for the event streaming system
3. **Recursive Improvement Manager**: Orchestrates the improvement process
4. **Improvement Script**: CLI tool to run the improvement process

## Key Features

### 1. Test Execution

The system runs comprehensive tests for:
- Event stream functionality
- Event conversion and mapping
- Workflow integration
- Step execution and error handling

### 2. Result Analysis

The system analyzes test results to:
- Identify failures and edge cases
- Detect performance bottlenecks
- Evaluate error handling robustness
- Find opportunities for optimization

### 3. Improvement Suggestions

Based on the analysis, the system generates improvement suggestions:
- Code snippets for enhanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Reliability improvements
- Code quality enhancements

### 4. Prioritization

Improvements are categorized by priority:
- **High**: Critical issues that affect functionality
- **Medium**: Performance improvements and optimizations
- **Low**: Code quality and nice-to-have enhancements

## Usage

### Running the Improvement Process

To run the recursive improvement process:

```bash
# Navigate to the test-utils directory
cd src/lib/test-utils

# Run the improvement script
ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register improve-script.ts
```

The script requires:
- `E2B_API_KEY` environment variable
- Node.js 16+ with TypeScript

### Integration with CI/CD

The improvement process can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to:
- Automatically run tests and suggest improvements
- Generate improvement PRs for high-priority issues
- Track workflow reliability over time

## Implementation Details

### Test Coverage

The current implementation focuses on testing:
- Event Stream Writer
- Event conversion and mapping
- Error handling in workflow steps
- Step execution lifecycle

### Improvement Categories

The system can suggest improvements for:
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Event processing
- Workflow orchestration
- Step implementation

## Future Work

Planned enhancements to the recursive improvement system:

1. **Automatic PR Generation**: Create pull requests for high-priority improvements
2. **Regression Testing**: Test that improvements don't break existing functionality
3. **Code Quality Metrics**: Track code quality over time
4. **Learning System**: Improve suggestion quality based on accepted/rejected changes
5. **Extended Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for all workflow components

## Conclusion

The recursive improvement system provides a powerful mechanism for enhancing the reliability and performance of Mastra vNext workflows through automated testing, analysis, and improvement suggestions. It demonstrates the potential of using E2B secure runtime for not just testing but also code improvement and quality assurance.
