# HyperAgent: Intelligent Browser Automation with LLMs

## Overview

HyperAgent is Playwright supercharged with AI.

### Features

- 🤖 **AI Commands**: Simple APIs like `page.ai()` and `executeTask()` for any AI automation
- 🛡️ **Stealth Mode**: Built-in patches to avoid being detected
- ⚡ **Fallback to Regular Playwright**: Use regular Playwright when AI isn't needed

## Integration with Autonomous Agent Framework

HyperAgent provides essential browser automation capabilities that can be leveraged within our autonomous agent system:

1. **Task-Based Execution**: Aligns perfectly with our Agent Loop Architecture through synchronous and asynchronous task execution modes
2. **Multi-Page Management**: Enables sophisticated multi-source research through parallel page control
3. **Structured Output**: Supports Zod schema definition for typed outputs, compatible with our schema-based architecture
4. **LLM Provider Flexibility**: Works with both Gemini and Claude through the Langchain integration
5. **MCP Support**: Functions as a fully compatible MCP client, enhancing our tool ecosystem
6. **Custom Actions**: Extensible with custom actions that can integrate with our search providers (Exa, Jina, Firecrawl)

## Example Implementation with AI SDK and Mastra

```typescript
import { HyperAgent } from "@hyperbrowser/agent";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

// Initialize the Mastra agent with AI SDK model
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "QSearch",
  instructions: "Comprehensive instructions for enhanced search capabilities...",
  model: anthropic("claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
});

// Initialize HyperAgent for browser automation
const browserAgent = new HyperAgent({
  browserProvider: "local",
});

// Register browser agent as a tool in Mastra
agent.registerTool({
  name: "browser",
  description: "Automated browser for web interaction and content extraction",
  handler: async (query) => {
    const result = await browserAgent.executeTask(query);
    return result.output;
  }
});

// API route example
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const stream = await agent.stream(messages);
  
  // Return the stream response for real-time updates
  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

## Key Capabilities for Autonomous Search

HyperAgent enables our autonomous agent to perform crucial web interaction tasks:

1. **Dynamic Content Navigation**: Unlike static scrapers, can interact with SPAs and complex interfaces
2. **Multi-Context Research**: Can maintain multiple research threads across different pages
3. **Structured Data Extraction**: Can extract and validate data according to predefined schemas
4. **Autonomous Decision Making**: Can make navigation decisions based on page content and context
5. **Error Recovery**: Can handle failures and retry with alternative approaches
6. **Result Integration**: Can synthesize findings across multiple sources and sessions

## Implementation Considerations

When integrating HyperAgent into our autonomous agent architecture:

1. **Resource Management**: Browser instances should be pooled and reused appropriately
2. **Error Boundaries**: Ensure proper error handling for browser automation failures
3. **Session Persistence**: Consider how to maintain browser state across multiple query steps
4. **Output Normalization**: Standardize outputs to fit into our event streaming system
5. **Security Boundaries**: Enforce proper sandboxing around browser automation
6. **Scale Consideration**: Support transition to cloud browser providers for production

By integrating HyperAgent with our Mastra vNext workflows and AI SDK model routing, we can achieve sophisticated browser automation capabilities within our autonomous agent framework.
