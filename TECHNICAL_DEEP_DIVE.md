*Published: January 9, 2025*

Building a search platform that simultaneously queries multiple engines while delivering coherent, intelligent results presents unique engineering challenges. Here's how we solved them.

## The Multi-Engine Challenge

Traditional search applications rely on a single search API or engine. SevenSearch needed to orchestrate queries across fundamentally different search technologies:

- **Exa**: Semantic search optimized for high-quality, authoritative content
- **Jina AI**: Neural search with advanced embedding-based retrieval  
- **Firecrawl**: Real-time web crawling and content extraction
- **Custom Providers**: Specialized search APIs for academic, code, and domain-specific content

Each provider has different APIs, response formats, rate limits, and strengths. Our challenge was creating a unified system that leverages the best of each while presenting a seamless experience to users.

## Architecture Overview

### Mastra Framework Foundation

SevenSearch is built on the Mastra framework, which provides:
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complex multi-step search processes with conditional logic
- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interfaces for different search APIs
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live result updates as searches complete
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Core search workflow
const searchWorkflow = new Workflow({
  steps: [
    queryEnhancement,     // AI-powered query optimization
    multiEngineSearch,    // Parallel provider queries
    resultAggregation,    // Deduplication and synthesis
    contentSummarization, // AI-generated insights
    responseStreaming     // Real-time client updates
  ]
})
```

## Query Enhancement and Routing

Before hitting multiple search engines, SevenSearch employs AI to optimize queries for each provider:

### Intelligent Query Adaptation
```typescript
const enhanceQuery = async (originalQuery: string, provider: string) => {
  switch (provider) {
    case 'exa':
      return optimizeForSemanticSearch(originalQuery)
    case 'jina': 
      return enhanceForNeuralRetrieval(originalQuery)
    case 'firecrawl':
      return structureForWebCrawling(originalQuery)
  }
}
```

### Category-Based Routing
SevenSearch analyzes query intent to determine optimal provider combinations:
- **Web searches**: Exa + Firecrawl for comprehensive coverage
- **Code queries**: GitHub Search + Exa for documentation
- **Academic research**: Semantic Scholar + Exa for papers and citations
- **Data analysis**: Specialized APIs + general web search

## Real-Time Result Orchestration

The platform's streaming architecture enables real-time result delivery:

### Parallel Execution
```typescript
const executeSearch = async (query: string) => {
  const providers = selectProviders(query)
  
  // Execute searches in parallel
  const searchPromises = providers.map(provider => 
    searchProvider(provider, query)
      .catch(error => handleProviderError(provider, error))
  )
  
  // Stream results as they arrive
  for await (const result of streamResults(searchPromises)) {
    yield processAndStream(result)
  }
}
```

### Result Aggregation Pipeline
1. **Deduplication**: ML-based similarity detection removes duplicate content
2. **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor relevance calculation across providers
3. **Content Synthesis**: AI summarization of related results
4. **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket-based live updates to the client

## AI-Powered Result Enhancement

### Content Aggregation
SevenSearch uses advanced NLP to identify and merge related results:

```typescript
const aggregateResults = async (results: SearchResult[]) => {
  // Group similar results using embeddings
  const clusters = await clusterBySimilarity(results)
  
  // Generate comprehensive summaries for each cluster
  const synthesized = await Promise.all(
    clusters.map(cluster => synthesizeCluster(cluster))
  )
  
  return rankByRelevance(synthesized)
}
```

### Intelligent Summarization
The platform generates contextual summaries that highlight:
- Key insights across multiple sources
- Conflicting information and different perspectives  
- Source credibility and recency indicators
- Related topics and suggested follow-up searches

## User Interface Innovation

### ChatGPT-Style Interface
SevenSearch's interface combines proven chat UX patterns with search-specific enhancements:

- **Prompt-Kit Integration**: Professional-grade input components with auto-resize and suggestions
- **Motion Primitives**: Smooth animations that provide visual feedback during search
- **Real-time Suggestions**: AI-powered query suggestions based on search context
- **Category Filters**: Dynamic filtering by content type, source, and recency

### Advanced Animation System
```typescript
// Example: Animated search results
const ResultAnimation = ({ children, delay }) => (
  <TextEffect 
    preset="fade-in-blur" 
    delay={delay}
    className="search-result"
  >
    {children}
  </TextEffect>
)
```

## Performance and Scalability

### Caching Strategy
- **Query-level caching**: Frequently searched terms cached for instant results
- **Provider response caching**: API responses cached with appropriate TTLs
- **Intelligent invalidation**: Cache updates based on content freshness signals

### Rate Limiting and Failover
```typescript
const providerManager = {
  async search(provider: string, query: string) {
    if (!this.isAvailable(provider)) {
      return this.fallbackSearch(query)
    }
    
    try {
      return await this.rateLimitedSearch(provider, query)
    } catch (error) {
      this.markUnavailable(provider)
      return this.fallbackSearch(query)
    }
  }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### API Rate Limiting
**Challenge**: Different providers have varying rate limits and pricing models.
**Solution**: Intelligent request distribution with prioritization based on query type and user tier.

### Result Consistency
**Challenge**: Different providers return vastly different result formats and quality.
**Solution**: Comprehensive normalization pipeline with quality scoring and standardized metadata.

### Real-time Performance
**Challenge**: Maintaining responsive UI while orchestrating multiple API calls.
**Solution**: Streaming architecture with progressive result loading and optimistic UI updates.

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced AI Integration
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: Multi-step reasoning over search results
- **Conversational Search**: Follow-up questions and context-aware refinement
- **Personalization**: Learning user preferences and search patterns

### Provider Ecosystem
- **Custom Integrations**: Enterprise-specific search engines and databases
- **Specialized APIs**: Domain-specific search for legal, medical, financial content
- **Real-time Data**: Integration with news APIs, social media, and live data sources
